## 1. Project Overview

HomeVault is a self-hosted property management web application. It tracks:

- **Expenses** — recurring and one-off property costs
- **Repairs** — repair jobs with status progression and contractor quotes
- **Upgrades** — home improvement projects with budget tracking and item lists
- **Loans** — mortgages and other property-related loans with repayment tracking
- **Wishlist** — future purchase items with priority and estimated cost
- **Purchase Costs** — one-time costs associated with buying the property
- **Calendar** — scheduled events and reminders
- **Inventory** — household item inventory
- **Dashboard** — aggregated summary of all the above

The app is designed to run as a Home Assistant addon (single-user, no-auth mode) or as a standalone web app with OAuth authentication.

### Key architectural decisions

- **tRPC** is used for all client↔server communication. There is no REST API; every data operation goes through a tRPC procedure.
- **Drizzle ORM** is used for all DB access. Raw SQL is not used anywhere.
- **wouter** is the client-side router (lightweight React alternative to React Router).
- **Dates are stored as `varchar(20)` strings** in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, not as MySQL `DATE` or `DATETIME` types. This avoids timezone conversion issues in MySQL but means the application is responsible for all date ordering and comparison.
- **Monetary values are stored as integers (cents/agorot)**, never as floats. All amounts are multiplied by 100 on write and divided by 100 on display.

## 4. Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node 24
- MySQL 8.4 running on `localhost:3306`
- pnpm 10

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy env and configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DATABASE_URL to your local MySQL connection

# Run all pending migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Start dev server (hot reload on both client and server)
pnpm dev
```

The server starts on port **3005** by default, scanning upward if that port is busy.

### Dev Login Bypass

In development (`NODE_ENV=development`), a mock login endpoint is exposed at `POST /api/dev/login`. The `MockLogin.tsx` page calls this. It creates or upserts a user with `openId = OWNER_OPEN_ID` (from `.env`, defaults to `"local-admin"`) and sets a session cookie valid for one year.

**This bypass is not available in production.** It is guarded by `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development")` in `server/_core/index.ts`.

### NO_AUTH Mode

Setting `NO_AUTH=true` in the environment auto-authenticates every request as the owner user. Designed for Home Assistant addon usage (single-user, trusted network). The user session is cached in memory after the first request to avoid a DB round-trip on every tRPC call (`_noAuthUserCache` in `context.ts`).

### Migration Command

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
# runs: tsx scripts/migrate.ts
```

Migrations are applied in numeric order. The file `0007_schema_v2_alignment.sql` is the most significant — it aligns the DB with the v2 schema field names (see §13).

---

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. Client calls `POST /api/dev/login` (dev) or completes OAuth flow (production).
2. Server creates a JWT via `sdk.createSessionToken()` (uses `jose` library).
3. JWT is stored in an `httpOnly` cookie named by `COOKIE_NAME` (from `shared/const.ts`).
4. Every tRPC request passes the cookie automatically. `createContext()` in `server/_core/context.ts` calls `sdk.authenticateRequest()` to verify and decode it.
5. The decoded user object (`User` from Drizzle schema) is attached to `ctx.user`.

### Property Authorization (Multi-Tenancy)

Every user can own one or more properties. The active property is communicated from the client via the `x-property-id` HTTP header on every tRPC request.

`createContext()` validates that the requested property actually belongs to the authenticated user:

```ts
const ownedProperties = await db.getPropertiesByUser(user.id)
const isOwned = ownedProperties.some(p => p.id === requestedId)
if (!isOwned) {
  propertyId = ownedProperties[0]?.id ?? requestedId  // fall back to first owned
}
```

This prevents a logged-in user from spoofing another user's `propertyId` header to access their data.

### Row-Level Authorization

tRPC procedures use a `protectedProcedure` middleware that throws `UNAUTHORIZED` if `ctx.user` is null.

Individual resource ownership (e.g. "does this expense belong to this user?") is checked via helper functions like `assertExpenseOwner(id, userId)`. **These are separate DB lookups after the fact** — a known weakness. The preferred pattern (encode ownership into the query WHERE clause) is documented in §15 as a planned improvement.

---

## 6. Database

### Connection

Drizzle ORM connects via `mysql2`. Connection string is read from `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.

```
mysql://homevault:homevault_dev@localhost:3306/homevault
```

### Tables

| Table | Primary Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | `int` autoincrement | Auth, openId from OAuth/HA |
| `properties` | `int` autoincrement | One per household |
| `expenses` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | Recurring + one-off costs |
| `repairs` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | Repair jobs |
| `repairQuotes` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | Quotes per repair |
| `upgrades` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | Home improvement projects |
| `upgradeOptions` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | Options/alternatives per upgrade |
| `upgradeItems` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | Shopping list per upgrade |
| `loans` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | Mortgages and other loans |
| `wishlistItems` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | Future purchase wishlist |
| `purchaseCosts` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | One-time buying costs |
| `calendarEvents` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | Scheduled events |
| `inventoryItems` | `varchar(36)` nanoid | Household inventory |

Note: `users` and `properties` use auto-increment integer IDs. All other tables use `nanoid()` string IDs for portability.

### Important Column Conventions

- **Monetary amounts**: stored as `int` in the smallest currency unit (agorot for ILS, cents for USD). Never stored as float. Divide by 100 for display.
- **Dates**: stored as `varchar(20)` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. No timezone conversion. Never use `new Date(dateString)` directly — use `date-fns` or string comparison.
- **JSON columns**: `attachments`, `repayments`, `payments`, `tags`, `pros`, `cons` are stored as MySQL `json` columns typed via Drizzle's `.$type<T>()`.
- **Enums**: all stored as MySQL `mysqlEnum`. Values are **lowercase with underscores** for status fields (`open`, `in_progress`, `waiting_for_parts`) and **Title Case** for category fields (`Maintenance`, `Plumbing`).

### Migrations

Migration files live in `drizzle/`. They are applied in order by `scripts/migrate.ts` via `pnpm db:migrate`.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `0001_*.sql` ... `0006_*.sql` | Initial schema creation |
| `0007_schema_v2_alignment.sql` | Major v1→v2 field renames (see §13) |
| `0008_expenses_paid_status.sql` | Adds `isPaid boolean` and `paidDate varchar(20)` to expenses |

**Never edit existing migration files.** Always create a new numbered file for any schema change.

## 7. Data Flow: DB → Server → Client

```
MySQL DB
  ↓ Drizzle ORM query (db.ts)
  ↓ tRPC procedure handler (routers.ts)
  ↓ HTTP (JSON over /api/trpc)
  ↓ TanStack Query cache (trpc client)
  ↓ React component render
```

### Critical Rule: No Field Aliasing

DB query results must reach the client with the **same field names the DB column has**. Do not rename fields between the DB and client (e.g. `label: u.title` is wrong — send `title` as `title`).

When aliasing was present (it was in `db.ts` for the dashboard query — `label: u.title`, `budget: u.estimatedCost`, `spent: u.actualCost`, `phase: u.phase`), it caused client-side bugs where the client read field names that didn't match what arrived. The aliasing has been removed from the active upgrades mapping; `Dashboard.tsx` now reads `u.label` (which is correctly aliased in the `getRecentActivity` helper — see observation below).

**Observation (2026-05):** `db.ts` `getRecentActivity` still uses `label: u.title` aliasing for the recent activity feed in the Dashboard. This is acceptable only because `Dashboard.tsx` explicitly reads `.label` from that specific response. It is isolated and documented. Do not extend this pattern.

---

## 8. API Layer (tRPC)

### Router structure

All procedures are defined in `server/routers.ts` as a single `appRouter`. Sub-routers:

- `data` — export, seedMock, deleteAll
- `property` — get, update
- `expenses` — list, create, update, delete, markAsPaid
- `repairs` — list, create, update, delete, updateStatus
- `upgrades` — list, create, update, delete, updateStatus, options, items
- `loans` — list, create, update, delete
- `wishlist` — list, create, update, delete
- `purchaseCosts` — list, create, update, delete
- `calendar` — list, create, update, delete
- `inventory` — list, create, update, delete
- `dashboard` — get
- `search` — query

### Input Validation

All mutation procedures have Zod input schemas. These are hand-written in `routers.ts` and must be kept in sync with `drizzle/schema.ts` manually. This is the primary source of field-name drift bugs. (See §15 for the planned `drizzle-zod` fix.)

### protectedProcedure

All procedures use `protectedProcedure` which throws `TRPCError({ code: "UNAUTHORIZED" })` if `ctx.user` is null. There is no public/unauthenticated tRPC endpoint.

### markAsPaid (expenses)

Sets `isPaid = true` and `paidDate = input.paidDate` on the expense record. **Note:** Earlier implementation incorrectly wrote to `notes` field instead. Fixed 2026-05.

---

## 9. Client Architecture

### Routing

wouter is used for client-side routing. Routes are defined in the main app component. Each route maps to a page component in `client/src/pages/`.

Key routes:
- `/` — Dashboard
- `/expenses` — Expenses list
- `/repairs` — Repairs list
- `/repairs/:id` — Repair detail
- `/upgrades` — Upgrades list
- `/upgrades/:id` — Upgrade detail
- `/loans` — Loans
- `/wishlist` — Wishlist
- `/purchase-costs` — Purchase costs
- `/calendar` — Calendar
- `/inventory` — Inventory
- `/settings` — Property settings

### Data Fetching

All server data is fetched via tRPC hooks (`trpc.expenses.list.useQuery()`, etc.). TanStack Query handles caching and invalidation. After a mutation succeeds, the relevant query is invalidated to trigger a refetch:

```ts
const utils = trpc.useUtils()
// after successful mutation:
utils.expenses.list.invalidate()
```

### Currency Display

`formatCurrency(amountInCents)` from `client/src/lib/utils.ts` handles display. It reads the property's `currency` symbol and `currencyCode`. All amounts passed to it must be integers (cents).

### Status & Priority Visual Conventions

Across all pages, status and priority states follow consistent visual patterns:

- **Unpaid / open / active** items appear at the **top** of lists, full opacity
- **Paid / completed / cancelled** items appear at the **bottom**, `opacity-60`, `text-muted-foreground`
- A labeled divider separates the two groups when both exist

Badge color conventions (defined per-page as `STATUS_BADGE`, `PRIORITY_BADGE` constants):
- Repairs: open=blue, in_progress=amber, waiting_*=orange, completed=green, cancelled=zinc
- Upgrades: idea=slate, planning=violet, in_progress=amber, completed=green, cancelled=zinc
- Priority: urgent=red, high=orange, medium=yellow, low=slate

### Expenses: Paid/Unpaid Sorting

The `Expenses.tsx` page sorts items client-side: unpaid first (newest first within group), paid last (newest first within group). Paid items display with `opacity-60` and a "Paid ✓" indicator. A divider row labeled "Paid" separates the groups.

---

## 10. Internationalization (i18n)

Translation files: `client/src/locales/en.json` and `he.json` (Hebrew).

The app supports RTL (Hebrew) and LTR (English). Layout uses `ltr:`/`rtl:` Tailwind variants and `me-` / `ms-` (margin-end / margin-start) instead of `mr-` / `ml-` to support both directions.

### Translation Key Conventions

- `status.open`, `status.in_progress`, `status.completed`, etc. — repair and upgrade statuses
- `priority.low`, `priority.medium`, `priority.high`, `priority.urgent`
- `frequency.monthly`, `frequency.quarterly`, `frequency.yearly`
- `categories.Maintenance`, `categories.Tax`, etc.

**Important:** Status keys use underscore (`status.in_progress`), not spaces or dashes. Enum values in the DB (`in_progress`) match the i18n key suffix exactly.

---

## 11. Mock Data & Seeding

Mock data lives in `server/mockData.ts`. It is seeded by `db.seedMockProperty()` in `server/db.ts`.

### Triggering a Seed

- **Via UI:** Settings page has a "Seed Demo Data" button that calls `trpc.data.seedMock`
- **Via CLI:** `node dist/index.js --seed-mock-only` (used in deployment scripts)
- **Via MockLogin:** `MockLogin.tsx` calls `seedMock` after the dev login

### Seeding behavior

`seedMockProperty` first deletes all existing data for the property, then re-inserts from `mockData.ts`. It is idempotent but destructive — calling it twice wipes any real data entered.

### Mock Data Paid Status (expenses)

Expenses in `mockData.ts` are authored with `isPaid: true` / `isPaid: false` to reflect realistic state. The rule: expenses with dates before the current month are marked `isPaid: true` with a plausible `paidDate`. Current-month recurring expenses are left unpaid to demonstrate the "Needs Attention" dashboard section.

**As of 2026-05:** Only 3 expenses are unpaid in the mock data: Mortgage April 2026, Va'ad Bayit April 2026, Arnona Q2 2026. The "Needs Attention" dashboard section should show exactly these.

### mockData.ts is untyped (known issue)

Mock data objects are not typed against `InsertExpense`, `InsertRepair`, etc. This means TypeScript will not catch missing or renamed fields at compile time. Fixing this is in §15.

---

## 12. Known Issues & Technical Debt

### HIGH — `routers.ts` and `db.ts` are monolithic single files

`routers.ts` (~600 lines) and `db.ts` (~950 lines) contain all procedures and all DB functions respectively. Finding a specific function requires grep. Business logic, data access, and data transformation are all mixed in `db.ts`.

### HIGH — No end-to-end type safety

tRPC output types are not inferred on the client. All page components use `any` for data from tRPC queries. Field name errors only surface at runtime as blank screens, not at compile time.

### HIGH — Hand-written Zod schemas can drift from Drizzle schema

Input validation Zod schemas in `routers.ts` are hand-maintained. When a column is renamed in `drizzle/schema.ts`, the Zod schema and all client code must be manually updated. This has caused multiple bugs (see §13).

### MEDIUM — `assertExpenseOwner` pattern is inefficient and incomplete

The pattern of fetching a record then checking ownership (`assertExpenseOwner`, `assertRepairOwner`, etc.) makes 2 DB queries where 1 would suffice. The WHERE clause approach is more correct. Also: not all entities have consistent ownership assertion patterns.

### MEDIUM — No rate limiting on any endpoint

Auth endpoints and all mutation procedures accept unlimited requests. No brute-force protection.

### MEDIUM — ENV object has no validation

`server/_core/env.ts` reads env vars with `?? ""` fallbacks. A missing `JWT_SECRET` or `DATABASE_URL` fails silently (or fails later with a confusing error). No startup validation.

### MEDIUM — `upgrades` table still has orphaned `phase` column

The `phase varchar(100)` column exists in the schema and DB but is not used anywhere in the application. The concept of "phase" was removed in favor of `status`. The column should be dropped in a future migration.

### LOW — No pagination

All list endpoints return every record for the property. With real long-term data (years of monthly expenses, many repairs), this will cause performance problems.

### LOW — `getRecentActivity` aliasing

`db.ts` `getRecentActivity` maps `expenses.name` → `label`, `repairs.title` → `label`, `upgrades.title` → `label` for the activity feed. This is intentional for the dashboard's "recent activity" component but is isolated and inconsistent with the no-aliasing rule. Should be refactored when splitting `db.ts`.

### LOW — Soft deletes not implemented

Deleting an expense, repair, or loan is permanent. For a financial tracking app, this means losing historical data with no recovery path.

---

## 13. Schema History (v1 → v2 Field Renames)

**Context:** An AI assistant (Perplexity) rewrote `drizzle/schema.ts` to use improved field names without updating the server or client code. This caused a cascade of bugs where fields stored under new names were read by old names, producing blank displays throughout the app.

The fixes were applied manually over multiple sessions (2026-05).

### Field name changes

| Table | v1 name | v2 name | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| expenses | `label` | `name` | |
| expenses | `recurringFrequency` | `recurringInterval` | |
| repairs | `label` | `title` | |
| upgrades | `label` | `title` | |
| upgrades | `budget` | `estimatedCost` | |
| upgrades | `spent` | `actualCost` | |
| loans | — | `originalAmount` | replaces `totalAmount` |
| loans | — | `currentBalance` | new field |
| loans | — | `endDate` | replaces `dueDate` |
| wishlistItems | `label` | `name` | |
| wishlistItems | `estimatedCost` | `estimatedPrice` | |
| wishlistItems | `description` | `notes` | |
| purchaseCosts | `label` | `name` | |

### Enum value changes

| Table | Field | v1 values | v2 values |
|---|---|---|---|
| repairs | `priority` | `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `urgent` |
| repairs | `status` | `Assessment`, `Quoting`, `Scheduled`, `In Progress`, `Resolved` | `open`, `in_progress`, `waiting_for_parts`, `waiting_for_contractor`, `completed`, `cancelled` |
| upgrades | `status` | `Planning`, `Sourcing`, `Building`, `Done` | `idea`, `planning`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled` |
| loans | `loanType` | `Family`, `Bank`, `Friend`, `Other` | `mortgage`, `heloc`, `personal`, `construction`, `other` |
| wishlistItems | `priority` | `Low`, `Medium`, `High` | `low`, `medium`, `high` |

### Phase concept removed

Repairs and upgrades previously had a UI concept of "Phase" (Assessment/Quoting/Scheduled for repairs; Planning/Sourcing/Building/Done for upgrades). **These never existed as DB columns** — they were invented by the v1 UI and mapped to status values. The v2 UI removes Phase entirely and uses the `status` column directly with a status stepper UI component.

The `upgrades` table still has a `phase varchar(100)` column (legacy, unused).

---

## 14. Security Assessment

### What is in place

- JWT session tokens via `jose`, stored in `httpOnly` cookies
- `protectedProcedure` middleware on all tRPC procedures
- Property ownership validated in `createContext()` on every request
- Parameterized queries via Drizzle ORM (no raw SQL, no injection risk)
- Dev-only login bypass guarded by `NODE_ENV` check

### What is missing or weak

| Issue | Risk | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `assertOwner` is a post-fetch check, not in WHERE clause | IDOR possible if check logic has a bug | Not fixed |
| No rate limiting | Brute force / DoS | Not implemented |
| ENV vars not validated at startup | Silent misconfiguration | Not implemented |
| JWT secret defaults to `"local-dev-secret-change-in-production"` in example | Trivial to break if not changed in prod | Documented |
| No structured error logging | Operational blind spot | Not implemented |
| No dependency vulnerability scanning in CI | Vulnerable packages go undetected | Not implemented |
| Soft deletes not implemented | No audit trail for financial data | Not implemented |
| Mock login session valid for 1 year | Overly permissive for dev | Low risk (dev only) |

---

## 15. Planned Improvements

Listed in priority order. Do not implement without updating this file.

### P1 — Type safety end-to-end (drizzle-zod + tRPC output types)

- Install `drizzle-zod`
- Replace hand-written Zod schemas in `routers.ts` with `createInsertSchema(table).omit({id, ownerId, propertyId, createdAt, updatedAt})`
- Export `RouterOutputs` from the server router and import in client pages
- Replace all `any` in page components with inferred types
- **Effect:** Field renames in schema.ts produce TypeScript compile errors everywhere they're used. Bugs caught at build time, not runtime.

### ~~P2 — ENV validation at startup~~ ✅ DONE (2026-05)

- `server/_core/env.ts` rewritten with Zod schema
- `server/_core/env.test.ts` — 9 tests
- `server/test-setup.ts` + `vitest.config.ts` setupFiles added

### P3 — Authorization: encode ownership in queries

- Remove `assertExpenseOwner`, `assertRepairOwner`, etc.
- Add `ownerId` / `propertyId` to every query WHERE clause
- Single DB round-trip instead of two, and no separate ownership check that can be missed

### ~~P4 — Unit tests for business logic~~ ✅ DONE (2026-05)

- `server/db.business.test.ts` — 19 tests covering `getOverdueExpenses`, `calcMonthlyStats`, `buildLoanSummary`
- The three functions exported from `db.ts` to make them testable
- Includes a named regression test: "excludes paid expenses — the critical bug that was fixed"

### P5 — Split `db.ts` into per-entity files

```
server/db/
  client.ts        ← drizzle connection
  expenses.ts
  repairs.ts
  upgrades.ts
  loans.ts
  wishlist.ts
  purchaseCosts.ts
  dashboard.ts
  seed.ts
```

### ~~P6 — Type mock data~~ ✅ DONE (2026-05)

- `server/mockData.ts` — `Seed<T>` helper type strips server-assigned fields (`id`, `ownerId`, `propertyId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`)
- All 9 mock arrays typed against `InsertExpense`, `InsertRepair`, etc. from `drizzle/schema.ts`
- **Bug found and fixed by typing:** `upgradeOptions` objects had `notes` fields that were silently never persisted (column doesn't exist). Notes folded into `description`. 4 stale `phase:` fields also removed from `mockUpgrades`.

### ~~P7 — Drop orphaned `upgrades.phase` column~~ ✅ DONE (2026-05)

- `drizzle/0009_drop_upgrade_phase.sql` — migration applied
- `drizzle/schema.ts` — `phase` field removed from upgrades table definition

### P8 — Rate limiting

Apply to auth endpoints and mutation procedures. `express-rate-limit` or similar.

### P9 — Pagination

> Append an entry whenever a meaningful change is made to the codebase. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD | What changed | Why`

| Date | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05 | v1→v2 field rename fixes across all pages and routers | Perplexity AI renamed schema fields without updating server/client code, causing blank displays |
| 2026-05 | Removed Phase concept from Repairs and Upgrades UI | Phase never existed as a DB column; replaced with status stepper |
| 2026-05 | `getOverdueExpenses` — added `!e.isPaid` filter | Paid expenses were appearing in Dashboard "Needs Attention" section |
| 2026-05 | `markAsPaid` handler — fixed to write `isPaid`/`paidDate` fields | Handler was writing to `notes` instead of the actual DB columns |
| 2026-05 | `drizzle/schema.ts` — added `isPaid boolean`, `paidDate varchar(20)` to expenses | Columns existed in DB but were missing from schema type definition |
| 2026-05 | `drizzle/0008_expenses_paid_status.sql` — migration for isPaid/paidDate | Formal migration file for the above columns |
| 2026-05 | Expenses page — unpaid items sort to top, paid items grey out at bottom | UX improvement for readability; matches Repairs/Upgrades pattern |
| 2026-05 | Dashboard `PHASE_DOT` → `STATUS_DOT`, `u.phase` → `u.status` | `phase` field doesn't exist on Upgrade; was always `undefined` |
| 2026-05 | `db.ts` activeUpgrades mapping — `phase: u.phase` → `status: u.status` | Same as above — sending non-existent field to client |
| 2026-05 | Mock data — historical expenses marked `isPaid: true` | All past expenses appeared as overdue in dashboard |
| 2026-05 | DB patched live — 18 historical expenses set `isPaid = true` | Sync existing seeded data with the new mock data intent |
| 2026-05 | `trace.md` created | Ground rule: all observations and changes documented in one place |
| 2026-05 | ENV validation at startup — `server/_core/env.ts` rewritten with Zod schema | Missing DATABASE_URL or JWT_SECRET now causes a clear startup failure instead of silent misconfiguration. Added `server/test-setup.ts` and `vitest.config.ts` setupFiles so all tests have required env vars. 9 new tests in `env.test.ts`. |
| 2026-05 | Dropped `upgrades.phase` column — migration `0009_drop_upgrade_phase.sql` | Column was never written to; Phase concept was removed in v2. Dead column removed from schema and DB. |
| 2026-05 | Unit tests for business logic — `server/db.business.test.ts` | 19 tests for `getOverdueExpenses`, `calcMonthlyStats`, `buildLoanSummary`. Includes named regression test for the isPaid bug. Functions exported from db.ts to enable testing. |
| 2026-05 | Typed mock data — `server/mockData.ts` | Added `Seed<T>` helper and typed all 9 mock arrays against schema insert types. Discovered and fixed: `upgradeOptions` had `notes` fields never persisted (no column); 4 stale `phase:` fields removed. |
